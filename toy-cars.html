  <div class="content"> This was my first game project with Unity. It is a physics based puzzle game with hotwheel-like mechanics. Baically, the player arranges different types of tracks to get the car form the start point to the finish point. I worked on the programming of the game while a friend worked on the game design. <br>

    Although the game is quite fleshed out; it has a level system, scoring, coins, track penetration detection, UI and more, we had to cancle the project because of the inconsistency of physics in Unity across platforms. A deterministic physics engine had to be made to overcome this issue, which was beyond what we had intended. <br>

    <br>
    The project contains paid assets (mainly camera movement) and therefore I cannot share the source code. I have chosen an Editor code that I thought would show some code that is not completely tied to other classes, <a href="https://github.com/baseltaleb/toycars" style="color: cadetblue"> here</a> <br>
